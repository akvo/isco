## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

**Unit Tests (70% of tests):**
- Test domain logic in isolation with mocked dependencies.
- Speed: Fast (<100ms per test).
- Backend: `./dc.sh exec backend ./test.sh`
- Frontend: `./dc.sh exec frontend yarn test` (Jest)
- Coverage Goal: >85% of domain logic.

**Integration Tests (20% of tests):**
- Test component interaction with infrastructure (database, APIs).
- Speed: Medium (100ms-5s per test).
- Coverage Goal: All adapter implementations.

**End-to-End Tests (10% of tests):**
- Test complete user journeys through all layers.
- Speed: Slow (5s-30s per test).
- Coverage Goal: Happy paths, critical business flows.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**

1. **Red:** Write a failing test for the next bit of functionality.
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to make test pass.
3. **Refactor:** Clean up code while keeping tests green.
4. **Repeat:** Next test.

### Test Organization

**Backend (Python/pytest):**
- Co-locate in `/backend/tests/` directory.
- Naming: `test_*.py` (Unit), `test_*_integration.py` (Integration).
- Use class-based test grouping: `class TestFeatureName:`.

**Frontend (React/Jest):**
- Co-locate tests next to components or in `tests/` folders within features.
- Naming: `*.test.jsx` or `*.spec.jsx`.
- Use React Testing Library for component tests.

### Test Quality Standards

**AAA Pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert):**
```python
# Arrange: Set up test data
user_data = {"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Test User"}

# Act: Execute the code under test
result = await create_user(user_data)

# Assert: Verify expected outcome
assert result.email == "test@example.com"
```

**Test Naming:**
- Descriptive: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`
- Backend: `test_returns_404_when_user_not_found`
- Frontend: `should render error when API fails`
