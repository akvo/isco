There are more elements to align on i.e.: a global average% can be misleading as some origins may have seen increases while others saw decreases--that can average out to zero and this information is lost. On those grounds, we are not clear what this data should be used for as its information content is quite limited. For Cocoa Life, for example, the premium is strictly separate from investments into trainings or capacity building or access to inputs of farmers.
